# ERC20 With QtumJS

In this chapter we will use [qtumjs](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtumjs) to build a NodeJS CLI tool to interact with the ERC20 [token we deployed previously](./erc20-token.md).

You can download the project code: [qtumproject/qtumbook-mytoken-qtumjs-cli](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtumbook-mytoken-qtumjs-cli).

For now, qtumjs relies on `qtumd`'s RPC service, so make sure that the docker container is running:

```
docker run -it --rm \
  --name myapp \
  -v `pwd`:/dapp \
  -p 9899:9899 \
  -p 9888:9888 \
  -p 3889:3889 \
  hayeah/qtumportal
```

## Note On NodeJS Compatibility

You'll need a version of `node` that supports [async/await](https://blog.risingstack.com/mastering-async-await-in-nodejs/). You should be ok if your version number is greater than 8.

My version is 8.6 (nothing special about this version...):

```
node --version

v8.6.0
```

I recommend that you download the [Long Term Support](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version (8.9.3):

![](./erc20-js/node-lts-8.jpg)

You can test whether async/await is supported or not by entering into the node REPL:

```
$ node
```

Then create an async function:

```
> async () => { }
[AsyncFunction]
```

> If for some reason you need to run qtumjs on a platform that does not support async/await, please [create an issue](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtumjs/issues).

## Note on Code Editor

For modern JavaScript development, you really owe it to yourself to try [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). `qtumjs` comes with static type definitions for its API, and with VSCode you get some of the most useful IDE features (e.g. type-accurate autocomplete) without the UX bloat:

![](./erc20-js/qtumjs-vscode.jpg)

While I am on my evangelizing soapbox, you should try [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) too! JavaScript is in fact an extremely powerful language, though it seems like a joke. TypeScript is the sobered-up version, yet retaining the same dynamism and expressivity that JavaScript developers love.

Now, back to QTUM :p

# Setup The ERC20 CLI Project

Let's clone the NodeJS project to the directory `mytoken-js`:

```
git clone https://github.com/qtumproject/qtumbook-mytoken-qtumjs-cli.git mytoken-js
```

The project dependencies are listed in `package.json`:

```
{
  ...

  "dependencies": {
    "minimist": "^1.2.0",
    "ora": "^1.3.0",
    "qtumjs": "^1.4.1"
  }
}
```

https://github.com/qtumproject/qtumbook-mytoken-qtumjs-cli/blob/23e6d0c40890075163eefacc0c66b018dc9c8bbc/package.json#L7-L9

Install these dependencies:

```
npm install
```

> Or `yarn install` if you prefer that. See: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

# Getting The Total Supply

Let's try to get the token's total supply. Run the script [index.js](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtumbook-mytoken-qtumjs-cli/blob/23e6d0c40890075163eefacc0c66b018dc9c8bbc/index.js):

```
node index.js supply

Error: Cannot find module './solar.json'
```

Oops, the script needs to load information about the contracts you have deployed.

```js
// Load deployment information generated by solar
const repo = require("./solar.json")

// Contract needs the contract address, owner address, and ABI.
const myToken = new Contract(rpc, repo.contracts[
  "zeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/CappedToken.sol"
])
```

+ The `require` function loads `solar.json` as a JavaScript object.

You should link (or copy) `solar.development.json` generated in the previous chapter to the project directory as `solar.json`:

```
ln -s ~/qtumbook/examples/mytoken/solar.development.json solar.json
```

> See an example [solar.development.json](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtumbook-mytoken-qtumjs-cli/blob/master/solar.development.json.example) file

Now try again:

```
node index.js supply

supply 14000
```

Yay it works (hopefully).

# Calling A Read-Only Method

The Solidity method we called is:

```
function totalSupply() public view returns(uint256)
```

The ABI definition (loaded from `solar.json`) is:

```js
{
  "name": "totalSupply",
  "type": "function",
  "payable": false,
  "inputs": [],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "type": "uint256",
      "indexed": false
    }
  ],
  "constant": true,
  "anonymous": false
}
```
https://github.com/qtumproject/qtumbook-mytoken-qtumjs-cli/blob/5e2e162efcd8d32971e7fab6d1c843ac1c843933/solar.development.json.example#L46-L60

And the call this method using JavaScript:

```js
// const myToken = new Contract( ... )

async function totalSupply() {
  const result = await myToken.call("totalSupply")

  // supply is a BigNumber instance (see: bn.js)
  const supply = result.outputs[0]

  console.log("supply", supply.toNumber())
}
```

https://github.com/qtumproject/qtumbook-mytoken-qtumjs-cli/blob/5e2e162efcd8d32971e7fab6d1c843ac1c843933/index.js#L15-L22

* `myToken.call("totalSupply")` returns a [Promise](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises), and `await` is a syntatic sugar to that waits for the asynchronous computation, then returns the result.
* Solidity numbers (int, uint, etc.) are represented in JavaScript using [BigNumber](https://github.com/indutny/bn.js/).

The `result` object contains other useful information aside from the returned values.

Do `console.log(result)` to print it out:

```
{ address: 'a778c05f1d0f70f1133f4bbf78c1a9a7bf84aed3',
  executionResult:
   { gasUsed: 21689,

     log: [] },
  outputs: [ <BN: 36b0> ] }
```

If you hover your mouse cursor over the `result` variable, you should see that its type is `IContractCallDecodedResult`:

![](./erc20-js/hover-call-result-typehint.jpg)

The type definition for [IContractCallDecodedResult](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/qtumproject/qtumjs@803dae6430e27a1903373eb6f2589d055ce16b73/-/blob/src/Contract.ts#L81
):

```js
export interface IContractCallDecodedResult extends IRPCCallContractResult {
    outputs: any[];
}

export interface IRPCCallContractResult {
    address: string;
    executionResult: IExecutionResult;
    transactionReceipt: {
        stateRoot: string;
        gasUsed: string;
        bloom: string;
        log: any[];
    };
}

export interface IExecutionResult {
    gasUsed: number;
    excepted: string;
    newAddress: string;
    output: string;
    codeDeposit: number;
    gasRefunded: number;

    gasForDeposit: number;
}
```

# Call Method With Arguments

The `balance` subcommand checks how many tokens an account has:

```
node index.js balance dcd32b87270aeb980333213da2549c9907e09e94

balance: 13700
```

The JavaScript code that implements this:

```js
async function balanceOf(owner) {
  const res = await myToken.call("balanceOf", [owner])

  // balance is a BigNumber instance (see: bn.js)
  const balance = res.outputs[0]

  console.log(`balance:`,  balance.toNumber())
}
```

https://github.com/qtumproject/qtumbook-mytoken-qtumjs-cli/blob/5e2e162efcd8d32971e7fab6d1c843ac1c843933/index.js#L24-L31

The arguments to `balanceOf` are passed in as an array.

# Send VS Call

Confusingly, there are two ways to invoke a method: `send` and `call`. These two names are inherited from Ethereum. A more descriptive way to name them is perhaps to call `send` "commit" and `call` "query".

* `call` (or "query"): executes contract code on your own local `qtumd` node as a "simulation", returning results, but not changing the blockchain. This is free.
* `send` (or "commit"): creates an actual transaction that would execute code globally on the network, changing the the blockchain. This costs gas.

Next, we are going to mint some new tokens using qtumjs. And because minting token changes the blockchain, we'll use `send`.


# Mint Tokens With Send

The `mint` command creates new tokens by using `send` to create a new transaction. Then it waits for that transaction to confirm:

```
node index.js mint dcd32b87270aeb980333213da2549c9907e09e94 10000

mint tx: 469d0e6a1e1a421c84cd009b983fc153aa5db7da26fa1f89837f2731fa75586c
{ amount: 0,
  fee: -0.081064,
  confirmations: 0,
  trusted: true,
  txid: '469d0e6a1e1a421c84cd009b983fc153aa5db7da26fa1f89837f2731fa75586c',
  walletconflicts: [],
  time: 1514442911,
  timereceived: 1514442911,
  'bip125-replaceable': 'no',
  details:
   [ { account: '',
       category: 'send',
       amount: 0,
       vout: 0,
       fee: -0.081064,
       abandoned: false } ],
  hex: '02000000014d195e5308764e1f64236c64b8975030dd8b8815d7cfa88ee838c029e64fa03f0200000047463043022052a137063b24e74c3953891230dae739ae3adfa2144c91805de4e46ae7c4b152021f0ccdf1b3e4dd86de7777f437447dd147955e9e112c2607bfd67ddc4e7d6e2001feffffff02000000000000000063010403400d0301284440c10f19000000000000000000000000dcd32b87270aeb980333213da2549c9907e09e94000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000271014a778c05f1d0f70f1133f4bbf78c1a9a7bf84aed3c2606ecea8d1010000
1976a914dcd32b87270aeb980333213da2549c9907e09e9488acc3080000',
  method: 'mint',
  confirm: [Function: confirm] }
✔ confirm mint
```

We should see that the balance had increased:

```
node index.js balance dcd32b87270aeb980333213da2549c9907e09e94

balance: 23700
```

The `mint` function source code:

```js
async function mint(toAddr, amount) {
  const tx = await myToken.send("mint", [toAddr, amount])

  console.log("mint tx:", tx.txid)
  console.log(tx)

  await tx.confirm(1)
}
```

* `tx` is the transaction submitted.
* `tx.confirm(1)` is a Promise that returns when there is one confirmation for the transaction.

# Token Transfer

Let's transfer tokens from `dcd32...9e94` to another account. The contract's `transfer` method takes two arguments:

* `_to` address is the receiver of the tokens.
* `_value` is the amount of tokens to transfer.

```js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
  require(_to != address(0));
  require(_value <= balances[msg.sender]);

  // SafeMath.sub will throw if there is not enough balance.
  balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
  balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
  Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
  return true;
}
```

Note that the API does not require the `_from` address. It is assumed that `msg.sender` is the source of the token balance to transfer from.

Ah, `msg.sender`, our old nemesis.

As we've learned in [The Owner UXTO Address](./erc20-token.html#the-owner-uxto-address), QTUM doesn't really have the idea of an "account". The `msg.sender` is the address of whatever UXTO that was used to pay for the transaction.

To act as `dcb3...9e94`, we need to explicitly specify an UXTO that has the same address. We can do this by using the `senderAddress` option.

```js
async function transfer(fromAddr, toAddr, amount) {
  const tx = await myToken.send("transfer", [toAddr, amount], {
    senderAddress: fromAddr,
  })

  console.log("transfer tx:", tx.txid)
  console.log(tx)

  // or: await tx.confirm(1)
  const confirmation = tx.confirm(1)
  ora.promise(confirmation, "confirm transfer")
  await confirmation
}
```

In the above code, the third argument of `send` allows you to specify the `msg.sender`. Remember to [prefund](http://localhost:4000/part2/erc20-token.html#prefunding-the-owner-address) this address with UXTOs.

There are other options you can specify for send. The full type definition is `IContractSendRequestOptions`:

```js
export interface IContractSendRequestOptions {
  /**
   * The amount in QTUM to send. eg 0.1, default: 0
   */
  amount?: number | string

  /**
   * gasLimit, default: 200000, max: 40000000
   */
  gasLimit?: number

  /**
   * Qtum price per gas unit, default: 0.00000001, min:0.00000001
   */
  gasPrice?: number | string

  /**
   * The quantum address that will be used as sender.
   */
  senderAddress?: string
}
```

To test `transfer`, let's generate a new receiver address, and convert it to hex:

```
qcli getnewaddress
qXuvswhQ9Vjza8AFj1vmUL4N531CDVoWsz

qcli gethexaddress qXuvswhQ9Vjza8AFj1vmUL4N531CDVoWsz
9d748f98e65c6875dbed7bfb6ffbeca426ff9cc6
```

To transfer 100 tokens from `dcb3...9e94`:

```
node index.js transfer \
 qdgznat81MfTHZUrQrLZDZteAx212X4Wjj \
 9d748f98e65c6875dbed7bfb6ffbeca426ff9cc6 \
 100

transfer tx: a1ba017b3974b98bf9c8edc824c3abc0ce17678a14e7cfac94b5900a290bdd07
✔ confirm transfer
```

> Note that we MUST specify the senderAddress using base58 address format. We'll fix this in the future. See: [qtumjs issues#2](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtumjs/issues/2)

We can then verify that `9d74...9cc6` had indeed received the tokens:

```
node index.js balance 9d748f98e65c6875dbed7bfb6ffbeca426ff9cc6

balance: 100
```

And that the origin account's balance decremented by 100:

```
node index.js balance dcd32b87270aeb980333213da2549c9907e09e94

balance: 23600
```

# Observing Contract Events

The `CappedToken` contract defines a few events. The `Transfer` event is emitted whenever fund is moved from one account to another (also when minting new tokens). The `Transfer` event:

```
event Transfer(
  address indexed from,
  address indexed to,
  uint256 value
);
```

Let's use qtumjs to subscribe to the stream of contract events, so we can react in a timely manner when a transfer occurs. The code:

```js
async function streamEvents() {
  console.log("Subscribed to contract events")
  console.log("Ctrl-C to terminate events subscription")

  // Start observing from the latest block height
  let nextblock = "latest"

  while (true) {
    // This is a long-poll HTTP request, which waits, and returns
    // when events become available.
    const result = await myToken.logs({
      from: nextblock,
      minconf: 1,
    })

    // Print out all event items
    for (const entry of result.entries) {
      console.log(entry)
    }

    // The result tells us which block to start
    // looking for new events.
    nextblock = result.nextblock
  }
}
```

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/323d1fa9415695f9132af17a9ebd57642afb7f29/contracts/token/BasicToken.sol#L29

The above is an asynchronous loop that waits for new events to happen, prints them out, then waits again for new events.

Let's see it in action. Launch the `events` subscriber:

```
node index.js events

Subscribed to contract events
Ctrl-C to terminate events subscription
```

The program hangs there waiting for new events. In another terminal, mint more tokens:

```
node index.js mint dcd32b87270aeb980333213da2549c9907e09e94 10000

mint tx: c0e3007178a1b9e05b33e770f7a0e7d084f2d06732658524be042dc0e9864cc4
```

Wait for a bit for confirmations. In the `events` terminal, you should see both `Mint` and `Transfer` events printed out:

# Conclusion

In this chapter we've developed a simple NodeJS CLI tool to interact with an ERC20 contract.

+ qtumjs is a Promise-based API. Use async/await to write clean asynchronous code.
+ `call` is like "query", `send` is like "commit".
+ Use `senderAddress` to in `call` or `send` to specify the `msg.owner`.

Now that you know how to use qtumjs, you are ready to build a DApp, and be on your way to fame and riches!
